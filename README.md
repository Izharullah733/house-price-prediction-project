# **House Price Prediction Project**

Welcome to the House Price Prediction Project! This repository contains a machine learning project that uses linear regression to predict house prices based on the California Housing dataset. The project includes data exploration, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and hypothesis testing.

**Project Overview**

Dataset: The project uses the housing.csv dataset(California house data from kaggle), which includes features like housing median age, total rooms, population, median income, etc., to predict median house values.
Model: A linear regression model is built after log-transforming the data for better distribution and handling outliers.

**Key Steps:**

Data loading and cleaning (handling nulls, encoding categorical variables).
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Descriptive stats, correlation matrix, histograms, boxplots, scatter plots.
Data transformation (log transformation).
Model training and evaluation (MSE, R² score, actual vs predicted plots).
Hypothesis testing on the overall model and individual features (F-test and t-tests).


**Files:**

notebooks/main.ipynb: Main notebook for data exploration, preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.
notebooks/hypothesis_testing.ipynb: Notebook focused on detailed hypothesis testing for the model and features.
data/housing.csv: The dataset file (add it here if it's not too large; otherwise, provide a download link in this README).



The model achieves around 70% accuracy (R² score) and MSE 0.11 after preprocessing.

**Prerequisites**

Python 3.8+
Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab for running the .ipynb files.
